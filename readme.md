Q&A
1. Q: Why would I want to "powerup" my Ethereum account in the first place?
1. A: With Account Modules, you will be able to access an non-ending and open-source set of new wallet features!

2. Q: Give me a practical example, I don't get it.
2. A: Gotcha. Let's say your private key is stolen or compromised. All your funds are gone, right?. This will no longer happen. The tech is ready to prevent this. You can install a "Spending Limits" Module where you can pre-define how much your account can extract daily, and then it will require more signatures or delays for larger extractions. Complementing the limits, you can install a "Social Recovery" Module, and ask your guardians to recover your account before your attacker can substract more. The UX of a bank account, but decentralized.
